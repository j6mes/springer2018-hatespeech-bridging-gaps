# Bridging the Gaps. Multitask learning for Hatespeech Detection

## Setup
This used some pretty old versions of PyTorch and I don't have a pip freeze, but perhaps the first versions above what's specified in requirements.txt would be sufficient.

## Data
All in data/

## Experiments
Run 

```
bash scripts/train_all_expts.sh
```
